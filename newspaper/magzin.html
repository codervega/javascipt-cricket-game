      <h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 50px;">This Section basically tells about The indian Economy from 2000 to 2023</span><br>
        Since gaining independence in 1947, India's economic history can be characterized by distinct phases. The initial decades saw a focus on socialist policies with the public sector playing a dominant role. In 1991, a landmark economic liberalization marked a shift towards market-oriented reforms, encouraging foreign investment and privatization. The Information Technology boom in the late 20th century positioned India as a global player in technology and services. Economic growth surged in the early 2000s, driven by sectors like IT and telecommunications. The mid-2000s witnessed infrastructure development projects and increased globalization. The 2008 global financial crisis had a limited impact due to prudent economic policies. Post-2010, India faced economic challenges, including a slowdown, but reforms such as GST and Make in India were introduced to spur growth. The demonetization move in 2016 aimed at curbing black money. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 posed a significant economic challenge, met with relief measures and a focus on self-reliance through the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative. The economic narrative post-2020 involves recovery, digital transformation, and structural reforms to ensure long-term growth.</h2>
